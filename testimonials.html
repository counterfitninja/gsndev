The standard of the work undertaken was faultless. The build was tricky with limited access, but they overcame the challenges. Nick managed the project well, which meant the works were completed within a reasonable timescale. We continued to reside at home throughout the works and GSN were extremely helpful, freindly and patient with the whole family (including the children) during the build which made it so much easier to have strangers in your home. We are so pleased with the finish they have achieved and would certainly be happy to invite GSN back for future works at our home. " </p><hr><p>"The GSN team work to an implicit set of highly commendable professional standards which ensured that the whole build was delivered with transparency, honesty and quality. From our experience, we highly recommend them to any prospective customer if they want a top-notch job to be delivered" </p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><div class="post__share"></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://www.gsndevelopments.co.uk/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://www.gsndevelopments.co.uk/projects.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Projects</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://www.gsndevelopments.co.uk/services.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Services </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://www.gsndevelopments.co.uk/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://www.gsndevelopments.co.uk/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://www.gsndevelopments.co.uk/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'overlay',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
